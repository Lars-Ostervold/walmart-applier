- **Relevance Checking**: Uses AI to evaluate job relevance based on your resume
- **Resume Optimization**: AI-powered resume editing to match job descriptions
- **PDF Generation**: Converts optimized resumes to ATS-friendly PDFs
- **Application Automation**: Automates the Workday application process
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Scheduled and manual testing workflows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and screenshot capture for debugging

## Usage

### Local Development

1. Run the test pipeline with a single job:
```bash
python main.py --limit 1
```

2. Run the full pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

### GitHub Actions

The project includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Test Pipeline** (`test_pipeline.yml`):
   - Manually triggered
   - Processes one job
   - Uploads artifacts for inspection
   - Commits changes to `processed_jobs.json`

2. **Scheduled Pipeline** (`scheduled_pipeline.yml`):
   - Runs twice daily (12:00 PM and 5:00 PM CT)
   - Processes all available jobs
   - Uploads artifacts
   - Commits changes to `processed_jobs.json`

### Artifacts

After each run, the following artifacts are available in GitHub Actions:
- Generated PDFs
- Edited Markdown resumes
- Processed jobs log
- Error screenshots (if any)

## Configuration

### Resume Files

- `base_resume.md`: Your base resume in Markdown format
- `cv.md`: Your detailed CV for reference
- `style.css`: CSS styling for PDF generation

### Job Filtering

The system automatically filters jobs based on:
- Previous application status
- Relevance to your profile
- Required skills (excludes Java-heavy or big data roles)

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Screenshots are captured on failures
- Detailed logging at each step
- Artifacts are preserved for debugging
- Failed jobs are marked for retry
