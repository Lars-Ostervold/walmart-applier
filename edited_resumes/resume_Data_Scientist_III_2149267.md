## TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE

### Senior Data Scientist | The Dow Chemical Company | April 2023–Present

*   Spearheaded the development and deployment of deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for molecule discovery, reducing search time by 87% and contributing to a patented innovation in gas treatment.
*   Architected and deployed a $40MM NPV customer-facing web application (R Shiny frontend, Python/Docker/Azure Container Instances backend) to process user-defined synthesis and optimization requests, automate experimental design, and generate robotic synthesis instructions.
*   Built and productionized AI-powered compliance chatbots (Python, Streamlit, OpenAI APIs), reducing lookup times by 10+ hours per review.
*   Designed and deployed a machine learning-driven customer web app (R Shiny, Python) with backend services deployed via Docker on Azure, supporting 400+ users.
*   Developed a Fortran-based kinetic model for novel alkoxylation catalysts to predict performance and safety-critical pressure profiles across lab, pilot, and commercial scales. Processed and prepared millions of plant data points using Python and pandas for non-linear regression, leading to the discovery of incomplete catalyst activation at steady state and a subsequent 12% increase in commercial reaction rate through an extended activation period.
*   Developed and deployed deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for accelerated molecule discovery, achieving an 87% reduction in search time and contributing to a patented innovation in gas treatment. Utilized chemical structure and property data to establish structure-property relationships, addressing data scarcity through robust training methodologies and validating model predictions with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for enhanced interpretability.
*   Recognized as top 5% of internal developers, earning Dow's ‘Champion’ Coder certification.

### Chief Technology Officer | LION Software | May 2024–March 2025

*   Spearheaded the development and deployment of a scalable data visualization and analytics platform, ensuring high performance and reliability for 100+ users.
*   Optimized complex graph network algorithms, reducing computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) to support real-time data insights.

### Ph.D. Researcher | The Pennsylvania State University | January 2021–March 2023

*   Designed and automated high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, boosting reaction yields by 288% while reducing manual run time by over 340%.
*   Developed Python algorithms for instrument data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, and report generation—saving 3 hours per run and enhancing data reliability for experimental workflows.

## PROJECTS

### Retail Analytics Dashboard | [Repo](https://github.com/Lars-Ostervold/m5-forecasting), [Dashboard](https://retailforecasting.streamlit.app/)

*   Developed an interactive retail analytics dashboard with advanced forecasting, product analysis, customer segmentation, and market insights using Python, XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Streamlit. Implemented clustering algorithms (K-Means, Autoencoders) for customer segmentation.

### Baptized Technology | [Repo](https://github.com/orgs/baptizedtechnology/repositories), [Website](https://www.baptizedtechnology.com/chatbots)

*   Designed and deployed scalable full-stack (Next.js) AI chatbots using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stack and cloud-based NLP solutions, handling 600+ monthly queries.
